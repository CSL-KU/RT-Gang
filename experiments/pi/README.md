# Raspberry-Pi Experiments
We have conducted the following experiments on Raspberry-Pi (referenced by
their respective figure in the paper):

- Fig5: Verification of RT-Gang with the help of synthetic real-time tasks
- Fig6 (d,e,f): Demonstration of benefits proferred by RT-Gang in a real
		setting using DeepPicar ([code](https://github.com/mbechtel2/DeepPicar-v2.git)) workload

Detailed instructions on conducting each experiment are documented in the
experiment's directory.
