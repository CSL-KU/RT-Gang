# RT-Gang Evaluation [WiP: Under Development]
This directory contains scripts for reproducing results we have published
related to RT-Gang. The scripts are organized according to the platform. For
example, scripts under the folder **pi** can be used to evaluate RT-Gang on
Raspberry-Pi.

Depending on the experiment, additional software packages will have to be
installed on the platform under test. These packages are listed under the
relevant experiment to keep the process simple and modular.
