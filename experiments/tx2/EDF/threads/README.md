# EDF Scheduling in Linux
I have created this repository to keep track of my experiments for understanding the EDF scheduling in Linux kernel with SCHED_DEADLINE.

## Resources
Following resources provide good reference material regarding SCHED_DEADLINE:
- [Linux Kernel Documentation for SCHED_DEADLINE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-deadline.txt)
- [Steven Rostedt's Presentation](https://elinux.org/images/f/fe/Using_SCHED_DEADLINE.pdf)
